# password-generator

## Description

The aim is to provide an application employees can use to generate a random password based on criteria that they have selected.

This application runs in the browser.  It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code to give its functionality.

It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The project involved writing the JavaScript code to give the application its functionality, with attention paid to using functions effectively, position of variables and avoiding unecssary code.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage
The webpage has a title and a sub-title, along with a box for the output and a button the user clicks to start.

When the button is clicked, a prompt appears to start the process.

It asks the user about:
- Password length. This must be between 8 and 128 (inclusive).
- Character types: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special characters

If the user enters criteria that are not valid, or leaves the password length field blank, further alerts are given.

Once the prompts have been answered, the password is generated and displayed in the box on the page.

The process can be used repeatedly without the need to refresh the web browser.
